A web server is software (and sometimes hardware) that stores, processes, and serves web pages to clients (browsers) via HTTP/HTTPS.

It receives requests from clients, retrieves requested content, and sends back responses.

Examples:

Apache HTTP Server

Nginx

Microsoft IIS

LiteSpeed

Node.js (Express.js for JS-based servers)
